# Odin Sketch

A Etch-a-Sketch-like toy where hovering over the tiles lights them up. The buttons below the grid can be used to change the grid size and toggle different drawing modes.

This project is part of the Foundations Course in the Odin Project, and demonstrates DOM manipulation via JS, CSS styling via flexbox, and use of event listeners.
